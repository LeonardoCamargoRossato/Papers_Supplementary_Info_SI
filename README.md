Structure of the Repository
1. Econophysics

    Paper Title: Analysis of Socioeconomic Indicators in Brazil and the Americas Using Econophysics Techniques
    Authors: Leonardo C. Rossato, Sebastián Gonçalves, José Roberto Iglesias
    Abstract: Our research employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating statistical mechanics and physical methods to analyze socioeconomic indicators across different countries. By leveraging graph theory and a variant of the Gravitational Clustering Algorithm, we reveal emergent patterns between HDI and population metrics in Brazil and other Latin American countries​

2. Condensed Matter Physics

    Paper Title: The Ising Bilayer Honeycomb Lattice: A Cluster Mean-Field Study
    Authors: Leonardo C. Rossato, F. M. Zimmer, C. V. Morais, M. Schmidt
    Abstract: This study explores the frustrated Ising model on a bilayer honeycomb lattice using the cluster mean-field approach. We discuss phase transitions and the influence of frustration on thermodynamic properties, highlighting the model’s rich phenomenology and tricritical behavior​
