Key Concepts 🔑

    Condensed Matter Physics: The area of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter.
    Ising Model: A mathematical model used to represent magnetic systems, crucial for understanding phase transitions.
    Frustrated Systems: Systems where spins cannot simultaneously minimize their interaction energy, often due to the geometry of the lattice or competing interactions.
    Phase Transitions: Changes between different states of matter, like from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phases.

Methodology 🧪

    Cluster Mean Field Theory: An approach used in this research to model frustration effects and evaluate the nature of phase transitions.
    Thermodynamic Quantities: The study examines parameters such as free energy and specific heat to understand the magnetic phases and identify tricritical behavior.
